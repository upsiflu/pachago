**Set up your IDE**

We use vscode but you can use any IDE. We recommend to install the language servers and your preferred extensions for git, elm, typescript, and graphQL as these are the languages we work with.

Install node LTS and git. If these are not compatible with your system, you can use remote IDE containers such as github codespaces (60 hours per month free).

### Develop the App

Follow the elm-pages [getting started guide](https://elm-pages.com/docs/getting-started).
